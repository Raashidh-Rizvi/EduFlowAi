## 1. Assignment Overview

Each group must design, implement, integrate, test and deploy one coherent software system that combines a web application, mobile application, RESTful backend, relational database and a meaningful Agentic AI workflow. The system must solve a credible real-world problem and demonstrate how modern software engineering frameworks work together.

> **Integrated-system rule:** The React and Flutter applications must use the same ASP.NET Core Web API, PostgreSQL database, user identity, permissions and business rules. Disconnected prototypes will not satisfy the assignment.

### 1.1 Assignment Objectives

- Apply ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, React and Flutter to a realistic full-stack problem.
- Design secure REST APIs, relational data models, web interfaces and mobile workflows.
- Implement a controlled Agentic AI workflow that plans, delegates, uses tools, validates results and requests human approval when required.
- Use Git, GitHub, automated testing, code review, CI/CD, documentation and deployment as part of professional software development.
- Justify framework and architecture decisions in writing through an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).
- Demonstrate individual technical ownership and the ability to explain, modify and debug submitted work.

### 1.2 Learning Outcome Alignment

This assignment assesses all four learning outcomes of SE3090, as stated in the approved module outline:

| Learning Outcome | Official Module Outline Wording |
|---|---|
| **LO1** | Evaluate different types of software engineering frameworks used in web, mobile, cloud, and AI-assisted software development. |
| **LO2** | Apply suitable frameworks and tools to build web, mobile, and full-stack software applications efficiently and effectively. |
| **LO3** | Use best practices for integrating frameworks, managing collaborative development, applying CI/CD, ensuring code quality, and deploying software solutions. |
| **LO4** | Select appropriate frameworks, tools, and agentic AI-assisted approaches to meet specific project and industry requirements. |

---

## 2. Required Technology Stack

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | C# and ASP.NET Core Web API. This is the mandatory public backend. |
| **Data Access** | Entity Framework Core with the PostgreSQL provider. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL. |
| **Web Application** | React using functional components, hooks, routing and a justified state-management approach. |
| **Mobile Application** | Flutter and Dart using a justified state-management approach. |
| **Agentic AI** | Any suitable and justified framework, such as LangGraph (the stack used in labs), Microsoft Agent Framework, LlamaIndex agents, Google ADK, or a custom orchestration approach. |
| **Version Control** | Git and GitHub from the beginning of the project, including a GitHub Actions CI workflow (see Section 13). |
| **Testing** | Suitable tools for backend, React, Flutter, integration, performance and Agentic AI evaluation. |

> **Mandatory backend rule:** React and Flutter must communicate only with the ASP.NET Core Web API. Where a Python Agentic AI service is used, it must operate as an internal service called by ASP.NET Core and must not be called directly by either client application.

---

## 3. Group Structure and Individual Contribution

The standard group size is four students. Each student must take primary ownership of one business component, so a four-student group must implement four primary components. If the lecturer-in-charge approves a different group size, the number of primary components must equal the number of students (for example, five students = five components). The lecturer-in-charge will confirm any proportional changes to the Agentic AI contributions and overall functional scope in writing.

| Student | Primary Component | Required Individual Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Student 1** | Component A | Backend, database, React, Flutter, tests, Git evidence, documentation and a distinct Agentic AI contribution. |
| **Student 2** | Component B | Backend, database, React, Flutter, tests, Git evidence, documentation and a distinct Agentic AI contribution. |
| **Student 3** | Component C | Backend, database, React, Flutter, tests, Git evidence, documentation and a distinct Agentic AI contribution. |
| **Student 4** | Component D | Backend, database, React, Flutter, tests, Git evidence, documentation and a distinct Agentic AI contribution. |

- There must be no project-manager-only, testing-only or documentation-only roles.
- Every student must contribute technically across the required stack and must have an identifiable Agentic AI contribution.
- Individual marks may be adjusted using Git history, pull requests, issue ownership, test evidence, code ownership, and responses to embedded viva and technical questions.
- Code or features that a student cannot explain, modify or debug may receive reduced or zero individual marks.

---

## 4. Domain and Functional Scope

Each group must select a unique real-world domain. Suggested domains include healthcare appointments, event management, travel planning, inventory, vehicle services, education, property rental, food delivery, recruitment, agriculture, tourism, help-desk systems and community services.

### 4.1 Minimum Domain Complexity

- At least three user roles with different responsibilities and permissions.
- For the standard four-student group, include at least four major business components with relational data and business-specific operations. An approved group-size variation must follow the one-component-per-student rule in Section 3.
- CRUD operations plus status workflows, search, filtering, sorting, pagination and reporting or analytics.
- Meaningful and different purposes for the React and Flutter applications.
- At least one third-party service integration.
- At least one complete cross-platform workflow involving React, Flutter, ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL and Agentic AI.

---

## 5. Part 1 – Secure ASP.NET Core RESTful API Backend

The ASP.NET Core backend is the authoritative application layer for public REST APIs, authentication, authorization, validation, business rules, persistence, Agentic AI workflow initiation, approval and audit logging.

| Area | Minimum Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Controllers, DTOs, service/application layer, suitable data-access abstraction and dependency injection. |
| **REST API** | Correct routes, HTTP methods, status codes, request/response models and asynchronous operations. |
| **Security** | JWT authentication, role-based authorization, protected endpoints, password hashing and secure configuration. |
| **Data Operations** | CRUD, search, filtering, sorting, pagination, history and business-specific operations. |
| **Quality** | Server-side validation, global error handling, structured logging, CORS and Swagger/OpenAPI. |
| **Agent Integration** | Endpoints for starting workflows, reviewing status, human approval and viewing execution summaries. |

> **Individual component minimum:** Each student-owned component must include at least four meaningful API endpoints and at least one business-specific operation beyond basic CRUD.

---

## 6. Part 2 – PostgreSQL Database

- Design a normalized relational database with an ER diagram and clear relational schema.
- Use primary keys, foreign keys, appropriate relationships, constraints, indexes and suitable PostgreSQL data types.
- Use Entity Framework Core migrations and suitable seed data.
- Apply transactions where required and maintain audit fields such as CreatedAt and UpdatedAt.
- Persist only the Agentic AI workflow state and execution summaries required by the design; do not store hidden reasoning, passwords, tokens or unnecessary sensitive data.

---

## 7. Part 3 – React Web Application

The React application should primarily support administrative, staff, dashboard, reporting, business-data management, Agentic AI monitoring and approval functions.

- Functional components, React Hooks, React Router and reusable component design.
- A suitable state-management approach such as Context API, Redux Toolkit, Zustand or another justified option.
- Complete ASP.NET Core API integration with protected routes and role-based navigation.
- CRUD interfaces, validation, search, filters, sorting, pagination and dashboard views.
- Responsive and accessible UI with loading, empty, success and error states.
- Agent workflow monitoring, execution summaries and approve/reject/revise controls where relevant.

---

## 8. Part 4 – Flutter Mobile Application

The Flutter application should primarily support user-facing or operational workflows. It must be a genuine mobile application that consumes the shared ASP.NET Core API.

- Reusable widgets, navigation/routing and a suitable state-management approach.
- Registration, login, logout, secure token storage and protected screens.
- Forms, validation, search, filtering, main business transactions, status tracking and history.
- Responsive layouts with loading, empty and error states.
- Agentic task submission, recommendation display and workflow status where suitable.
- At least one meaningful device feature, such as camera/image picker, GPS/map, QR scanning, file upload, notifications or date/time selection.

---

## 9. Part 5 – Agentic AI Subsystem

The Agentic AI feature must solve a meaningful, domain-relevant, multi-step problem. It must not be limited to a generic chatbot, FAQ interface, single-prompt workflow or simple text generator.

> **Minimum acceptance rule:** The group must demonstrate at least one complete assessed workflow that satisfies every step in the "Minimum assessed workflow" row below.

### 9.1 Minimum Agentic AI Requirements

| Requirement | Expected Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Minimum assessed workflow** | At least one assessed workflow must receive a domain objective; create a structured multi-step plan; delegate steps to distinct agent roles; call allow-listed tools using validated inputs and structured outputs; persist workflow state; apply deterministic checks such as schema or business-rule validation; pause a defined high-impact action for approval by an authorized user; and produce either an auditable result or a safe, clearly recorded failure. |
| **What counts as a distinct agent?** | An agent counts as distinct only when it has an identifiable responsibility, a defined input and output contract, controlled tool permissions and visible participation in the workflow. Renaming the same prompt or copying identical behaviour does not count as a separate agent. |
| **Specialized agents** | For the standard group, implement at least four distinct agents with clearly different responsibilities, such as planning or coordination, domain analysis, action or tool use, and validation or safety. Any approved adjustment must be confirmed in writing by the lecturer-in-charge. |
| **Planning and delegation** | The system analyses a user objective, creates a structured multi-step plan and delegates each step to an appropriate agent. |
| **Controlled tools** | Agents may use only allow-listed tools. Validate every tool input, return structured outputs, handle errors and apply least-privilege access. |
| **Shared state** | Persist the workflow ID, objective, plan, completed steps, tool results, validation results, errors, approval status and final outcome in structured, durable storage. |
| **Validation** | Apply deterministic validation, such as schema checks and business rules, before accepting outputs or allowing high-impact actions. Unsupported or unsafe actions must be rejected or returned for revision. |
| **Human approval** | At least one clearly defined high-impact action must pause until an authorized user approves, rejects or requests revision. |
| **Observability** | Store or display auditable execution summaries, tool calls, timings, validation results, errors, retries, approval decisions and the final result or safe-failure outcome. |
| **Security** | Apply role-based access, prompt and tool-input validation, output validation, secret protection, timeouts, retry limits and safe failure behaviour. |

> **Implementation flexibility:** Students may use any suitable Agentic AI framework, model and orchestration method. The selected approach must meet the minimum acceptance scenario, be justified in the ADR, run reliably during evaluation, be secured and be integrated through ASP.NET Core.

---

## 10. Required Integrated Architecture

### SE3090 Reference Integration Architecture

*A generic required structure; groups must design and justify their own domain architecture.*

**Figure 1. Reference integration architecture.** Groups must adapt and justify the architecture for their selected domain.

- **React Web Application** — Administration, staff, dashboards, reports, agent monitoring and approval → (HTTPS/REST/JSON) → **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Flutter Mobile Application** — User-facing and operational workflows, device feature and status → (HTTPS/REST/JSON) → **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** — Mandatory public backend; Controllers and DTOs; Application/service layer; Authentication and authorization; Business rules and validation; Audit logging and approval; Agent workflow endpoints
  - → (EF Core) → **PostgreSQL** — Entity Framework Core; Migrations and constraints; Transactional business data; Agent execution summaries
  - → (Internal call) → **Controlled Agentic AI** — Coordinator/planner; Domain analysis agent; Action/tool agent; Validation/safety agent; Structured shared state; Ollama local model; Allowlisted tools and traces
  - → (Controlled API) → **Third-Party Service** — Meaningful API or service integrated through controlled ASP.NET Core calls

### Required Cross-Platform Workflow Pattern

*At least one workflow must begin in one client and continue through the other client.*

**Figure 2. Required cross-platform workflow pattern.**

1. **Flutter** — User submits a domain transaction
2. **ASP.NET Core** — Authenticates, validates and applies rules
3. **PostgreSQL** — Stores business data and audit fields
4. **Agentic AI** — Plans, uses tools and creates a validated proposal
5. **React** — Staff reviews evidence and approves, rejects or revises
6. **Shared Status** — Backend updates record; mobile user receives status

*Evidence must show consistent identities, permissions, business rules, data and status across both applications.*

> **End-to-end evidence:** At least one demonstrated workflow must begin in one client, pass through ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL and Agentic AI, require review or approval in the other client, and return an updated status to the initiating user.

---

## 11. Third-Party Integration

Each system must integrate at least one meaningful third-party API or service, such as maps, weather, currency, email/SMS, payment sandbox, calendar, cloud storage, QR service or notifications.

- Explain the business purpose and user benefit.
- Route external-service access through the ASP.NET Core backend where appropriate.
- Protect credentials and environment variables.
- Handle timeouts, invalid responses, service failures and rate limits.
- Validate and minimize any personal or sensitive data shared with the service.

---

## 12. Testing Requirements

| Area | Required Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Unit, service-layer, validation, authentication/authorization, controller and API integration tests. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL integration tests, constraints, migrations and transaction behaviour. |
| **React** | Component, form-validation, protected-route, API-integration and error-state tests. |
| **Flutter** | Unit, widget, form-validation, navigation and API-integration tests. |
| **End to End** | At least one complete Flutter/React – ASP.NET Core – PostgreSQL – Agentic AI workflow. |
| **Performance** | Concurrent requests, response time, success/failure rate, database response and Agentic AI latency. |
| **Agent Evaluation** | Evidence that at least one complete minimum acceptance workflow passes a suitable golden case, including correct planning and delegation, agent and tool selection, structured outputs, deterministic validation, business-rule compliance, approval enforcement, prompt-injection resistance, failure recovery and safe failure. |

> **Agent evaluation rule:** LLM-as-a-judge may be used as supporting evidence, but it must not be the only evaluation method. Use rule-based assertions, schema validation, golden cases, deterministic validators and human review where appropriate.

---

## 13. Git, CI/CD and Collaborative Development

- Create the GitHub repository at the beginning of the project.
- Use meaningful commits, feature branches, issues, pull requests, reviews and a project board.
- Configure at least one **GitHub Actions CI workflow** that restores, builds and runs the automated backend tests on every push and pull request to the main branch. Additional pipelines (frontend build, lint, Flutter analyze, deployment) are encouraged.
- Maintain clear evidence of task allocation, merge management and conflict resolution.
- Each student must show regular technical contribution across the project lifecycle.
- Artificial commit activity, final-day bulk uploads or unexplained copied code will not be accepted as evidence of contribution.

---

## 14. Deployment and Documentation

| Component | Deployment Requirement |
|---|---|
| **ASP.NET Core API** | Deploy to a suitable cloud platform and provide a working health URL and Swagger URL. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Deploy securely with migrations, restricted credentials and initialization instructions. |
| **React** | Deploy and provide a working live URL configured to use the deployed API. |
| **Flutter** | Submit complete source code and a runnable Android APK or approved equivalent. |
| **Agentic AI** | Deploy or run locally as appropriate; provide complete setup, model/framework requirements and startup order. |

> **Service cost and availability:** You must be able to complete this assignment using institution-provided or no-cost services. Paid subscriptions are not required. Keep clear local setup instructions. If a required external service has a confirmed outage near submission or evaluation, inform that to evaluator and provide evidence of the outage. When you doing the evolution.

### 14.1 README and Technical Documentation

- Project overview, business problem, user roles, features and technology justification.
- System architecture, Agentic AI architecture, database design and repository structure.
- Installation, environment variables, database setup and startup instructions for all components.
- API documentation, test instructions, deployment instructions, live URLs and test accounts.
- Individual contributions, challenges, security considerations and AI usage declaration.

### 14.2 Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

As introduced in Lecture 01, each group must submit an Architecture Decision Record — a short document (one page per decision) capturing the context, options considered, decision and consequences for the group's key technical choices. The ADR is the primary written evidence for LO4 and will be referenced during the viva.

At minimum, record decisions for: the state-management approach in React and in Flutter, the Agentic AI framework and orchestration method, the database schema strategy for agent workflow state, and the cloud deployment platform. Three to six decisions is a typical, healthy range.

## 18. Usage of AI

This assessment is designed using the CLEAR Framework and the AI Assessment Scale (Perkins, Furze, Roe & MacVaugh, 2024). The permitted level of AI use, the tasks it applies to, the disclosure required and the marks awarded for process are set out below.

> **AI Use Level — Level 4 (Full AI):** AI tools may be used extensively during the permitted development tasks in Section 18.1 when all use is disclosed, verified and understood. During the final demonstration and viva, no external AI assistant, chatbot, IDE copilot or agentic coding tool may be used to answer questions, generate explanations or modify the submitted work (Level 1 — No AI).

### 18.1 Where AI Tools May Be Used

AI tools — chat assistants, IDE copilots and agentic coding tools — may be used for the tasks below. In every case the group remains fully responsible for the correctness, security, originality and understanding of what is submitted.

| Task / Section | Permitted use of AI tools |
|---|---|
| **Domain & requirements** (Section 4) | Brainstorm domains, roles, features and user stories; research the domain. The final scope must be your own and defensible at the viva. |
| **Architecture & ADR** (Sections 10, 14.2) | Explore options, compare frameworks, draft the ADR. The decision taken and its justification must be the group's own reasoning. |
| **Backend & database** (Sections 5, 6) | Generate, refactor and debug ASP.NET Core code; design schema, migrations, seed data, indexes and the ER diagram. All owner-reviewed and tested. |
| **React & Flutter** (Sections 7, 8) | Scaffold components and widgets, state management, routing, validation, styling, secure storage and device features. |
| **Agentic AI subsystem** (Section 9) | Agent design, prompt engineering, tool definitions, orchestration, validation and safety controls. Prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop validation are examinable at the viva. |
| **Testing, CI/CD & deployment** (Sections 12–14) | Generate and run tests and test data; write CI workflows; configure and troubleshoot deployment. Tests must be executed and understood, not only generated. |
| **Reports, README & diagrams** (Sections 14.1, 15) | Draft, structure and proofread. All facts, figures, screenshots, test results and evaluation findings must be your own. |

### 18.2 Where AI Tools May Not Be Used

- **Final demonstration and viva.** This evaluation is conducted under Level 1 (No AI). You may not use external AI assistants or agentic coding tools to answer questions, generate explanations or modify the submitted work.
- **Work you cannot explain.** Any code, test, diagram or documentation you cannot explain, test or modify may receive reduced or zero individual marks (Section 3).
- **Fabricated evidence.** Back-filled commit history, invented AI-log entries, or test/evaluation results that were not actually produced.
- **Confidential data and others' work.** Never share credentials, API keys, private or institutional data with an AI tool, or commit them to GitHub. Presenting another party's work as your own remains plagiarism, and the individual reflection must be your own writing.

### 18.3 Disclosure, Process Marks and Reflection

**Disclosure.** Each student must keep an individual AI usage log showing the date, tool and model, task or section, what the tool produced, what was changed or rejected, and how the result was verified. Include this log in that student's Individual Report section of the consolidated report. Include one consolidated group AI usage declaration in the Group Report section, confirming that all AI use has been disclosed and that every member can explain, test and modify the work submitted under their name.

**Process marks.** As AI use is permitted at Level 4, 30 marks assess the development process: 15 marks for technical understanding and ownership assessed through the viva and embedded across the individual criteria, 5 core marks for Testing, CI and Git Workflow, and 10 marks for Documentation and Deployment. These marks are assessed through the rubric in Section 16.1. **This meets the CLEAR minimum of thirty percent process marks for a Level 4 assessment.**

**Reflection (marked).** Each student must include an approximately one-page individual reflection in their Individual Report section of the consolidated report. It is marked under Documentation and Deployment and may be discussed during the viva. Address the following:

- Which AI tools, if any, were used, and at which stages?
- What did the AI tools do well, and what did they get wrong?
- What did you change, add or reject from the AI output, and why?
- What did you learn about your own skills and understanding?

*The AI rules above were agreed with the SE3090 cohort and are published on Course Web (SE3090 → Assignments → Assignment 1). A reflection that is AI-generated, or that does not match the student's Git history and AI usage log, will not receive credit.*

## 19. Academic Integrity

AI use that complies with Section 18 is permitted and expected. The following requirements apply to all submitted work, whether or not AI tools were used.

- Do not submit code or features that you cannot explain, test or modify.
- Acknowledge external libraries, APIs, tutorials, sample code and AI assistance.
- Maintain the AI usage log and submit the AI usage declaration.
- Do not expose credentials, private data or protected institutional information.
- Copying another group's code, agent design or reports, or submitting commissioned work, is a serious academic offence.
- Plagiarism in any form is not permitted, and standard SLIIT academic-integrity and plagiarism procedures apply to all submitted work.
